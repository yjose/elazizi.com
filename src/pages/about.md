## 👶 How I got where we are now

I was born in Rissani, a small town in the south-east of Morocco. I grew up in Errachidia and went to high school there. I studied Computer Science at the National School of Applied Sciences in El Hoceima in the north of Morocco and received my engineering degree in 2017.

I worked as a Software Engineer for one year at Sopra Banking Morocco in Casablanca, then moved to Obytes as a Software Engineer working remotely and mainly focusing on the frontend side.

## 🍊 What I Do at Obytes

I started my career with the Obytes team as a Frontend Developer and had the chance to work on React Native and ReactJS projects from day one. I ended up being a Mobile Tribe Leader in the last two years 🚀.

Right now, I am mainly focusing on React Native and helping a team of nine people to build mobile apps for our clients. I do this by setting best practices, reviewing code, writing docs, interviewing people, and helping the team solve issues. I also manage the team and help them grow as developers.

At Obytes, we believe in open source, which is why last year we had the opportunity to start open-sourcing our internal resources and best practices we use at Obytes to build mobile apps. You can check them out here: [Starter Kit](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes).

## 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 Community Work

It all began with an invitation to join a Facebook group, and I eventually became one of the core members of the community. 😀

I am part of the Geekblabla Community (formerly Facebook Developer Circle Morocco), a community for developers in Morocco 🇲🇦 that aims to help people learn and grow in the tech field with a Moroccan touch 😎

Over the past 5 years, I have had the opportunity to help build some incredible projects with the community, such as [GeeksBlabla.community](https://GeeksBlabla.community), [BlablaConf.com](https://BlablaConf.com), [StateofDev.ma](https://StateofDev.ma), [Awesome-Morocco](Awesome-Morocco.dev), as well as organizing meetups and workshops. Most importantly, I have been able to meet a bunch of amazing friends and help people grow in the tech field and the journey is still going on.

## 👀 Interests

While I am not working on Obytes tasks or community work or some side projects (which is rare 😅), I mainly like spending my time on one of the following:

- **🚶 Walking or Running**: Walking through the neighborhood or running while listening to an audio book/podcast or maybe music (depending on the mood 😀) is a daily habit for me.

- **🎥 Watching YouTube**: I am somewhat addicted to YouTube and can't stop watching videos about tech, software development, psychology and human behavior. check [Youtube channels](/uses#-youtube-channels) for recommendations

- **📚 Reading**: Not a lot, but I enjoy reading anything related to psychology and human behavior. You can check my top five books on the [Uses page](/uses#-books).

- **⚽️ Playing And Watching Soccer**: Playing soccer is one of my favorite hobbies and playing a game every week with friends is a must for me. I also enjoy watching soccer matches, especially the Real Madrid ones.
