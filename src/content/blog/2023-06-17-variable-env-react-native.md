![Environment Variables in React Native](/images/env-vars-react-native.png)

Managing environment variables in React Native is crucial for any project; it can be sometimes tricky and challenging. With all the options available out there, people tend to get lost and have a lot of questions. Do I need to use native packages or just load them using a Babel plugin? What about security, and how can I handle different environments like staging and production?

I have been there before and managed to find my way out of it, and today I will share with you how to do it the right way.

I know that "**the right way**" is a bold statement, but let's first agree on what "**the right way**" means when managing environment variables in React Native.

For me, the correct approach should be:

- **Easy**: It should be straightforward to add new variables and use them in the code.
- **TypeScript Support**: It should support typing with TypeScript so we can ensure we have autocomplete and type checking.
- **Build Time Validation**: It should be validated at build time to ensure all variables are set and provide a clear error message if not.
- **Multiple Environments Support**: It should support multiple environments, such as staging and production, and make it easy to switch between them.
- **Secure**: Environment variables should be secure.

I assume we all agree on the points above. If you have any other points, please let me know in the comments below.

Before we start, the approach is heavily based on the Expo ecosystem, so if you are not using Expo or the Expo Dev Client with your app, you may need to make some adjustments to make it work. And most importantly, you are missing out on a lot of cool features, my friend, if you are not using Expo. I cannot find a reason why you are not using Expo, especially after the release of the Expo Dev Client, which gives you the best of both worlds.

Now, let's see if we can make it and start coding.

## Step 1: Install the Required Packages and Create `.env` Files

First, we need to install those packages:

- [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv): To load the environment variables from the `.env` file.
- [`Zod`](https://zod.dev/): A validation library to validate the environment variables.
- [`expo-constants`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants): To get the `expoConfig` object from the `app.config.ts` file.

```bash
yarn add dotenv zod
# or pnpm add dotenv zod
npx expo expo-constants
```

Next, we need to create the `.env` files for each environment we have. For example, if we want multiple variants for staging and production, we need to create the following files:

```bash
.env.development
.env.staging
.env.production
```

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume we have only three variables in our `.env` files: `API_URL`, `BUNDLE_ID`, and `SENTRY_TOKEN` to upload the source maps to Sentry.

```bash title=".env.development"
BUNDLE_ID=com.example.app.staging
API_URL=https://qa-api.example.com
SENTRY_TOKEN=https://sentry.io/123456
```

> Other files should have the same variables with different values.

## Step 2: Create `env.js` File

To handle all logic related to environment variables, we are going to create a file called `env.js` at the root of our project.

> 💡 You may be wondering why we are not using the `.ts` extension for the `env.js` file. At the time of writing this article, you cannot import `.ts` files into the `app.config.ts` file; only `.js` files are supported.
>
> ⚠️ Please let me know in the comments sections if you know how to do it or if I am messing something.

### Part 1: Load the correct `.env` file.

```js title="env.js"
const z = require("zod");

const path = require("path");
const APP_ENV = process.env.APP_ENV ?? "development";
const envPath = path.resolve(__dirname, `.env.${APP_ENV}`);

require("dotenv").config({
  path: envPath,
});
```

To load the correct file, we use an inline variable environment called `APP_ENV` and set it to `development` by default. Then, we use the `dotenv` package to load the correct `.env` file based on the `APP_ENV` value.

Normally, the `APP_ENV` variable should be passed to the app while running NPM scripts, like the following:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "EXPO_NO_DOTENV=1 expo start",
    "start:staging": "APP_ENV=staging pnpm run start",
    "build:production": "APP_ENV=production pnpm run start"
  }
}
```

> 🚨 Starting from Expo SDK 49, we need to use the `EXPO_NO_DOTENV=1` environment variable to disable the automatic loading of environment files by Expo. Unfortunately, Expo is not extensible enough to enable us to load the correct `.env` file based on the `APP_ENV` variable.

For example, running `pnpm start:staging` will load the `.env.staging` file and we can access the variables using `process.env.VAR_NAME`.

### Part 2: Create a `schema` to validate the environment variables.

To validate the environment variables, we are going to use the `Zod` package. If you are not yet familiar with it, Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference. People use it to validate forms, API responses, and here we are going to use it to validate the environment variables.

Zod helps you define a schema for your objects and validate them. If the object does not match the schema, it throws an error or returns `false` in case you use the `safeParse` function. It's as simple as that.

> 💡 If you are not familiar with Zod validation, I recommend watching this quick video: [Zod Goes Where TypeScript Can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4h8PUVy5J8).

Let's see how we can use it to validate our environment variables.

```js title="env.js"
const z = require("zod");

// ... the code above

// creating the schema
const client = z.object({
  APP_ENV: z.enum(["development", "staging", "production"]),
  API_URL: z.url(),
});

const buildTime = z.object({
  SENTRY_TOKEN: z.string(),
  BUNDLE_ID: z.string(),
});

// Get the environment from the process

/**
 * @type {Record<keyof z.infer<typeof client> , string | undefined>}
 */
const _clientEnv = {
  APP_ENV,

  // ADD YOUR ENV VARS HERE TOO
  API_URL: process.env.API_URL,
};

/**
 * @type {Record<keyof z.infer<typeof buildTime> , string | undefined>}
 */
const _buildTimeEnv = {
  // ADD YOUR ENV VARS HERE TOO
  SENTRY_TOKEN: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
  BUNDLE_ID: process.env.BUNDLE_ID,
};
```

As you can see in the code above, we create two schemas: `client` and `buildTime`. In the `client` schema, you need to define all variables that you want to access in the `src` folder, and for the `buildTime` schema, you need to define all variables that you want to access only in the `app.config.ts` file.

For example, we only need the `SENTRY_TOKEN` in the `app.config.ts` file to upload the source maps to Sentry, so we add it to the `buildTime` schema.

Then, we need to create two objects for our variable environment: `_clientEnv` and `_buildTimeEnv`, and load the variables from the `process.env` object.

As you may have noticed, we are using the `z.infer` utility to get the type of the schema and use it as type annotation for the `_clientEnv` and `_buildTimeEnv` objects. This way, we can get typing errors directly from the editor if any variables are missed.

> ⚠️ Make sure you have `"checkJs": true` in your `tsconfig.json` file.

### Part 3: Validate the Environment Variables and Error Handling

Now that we have the schemas and environment variables, we can use the `safeParse` function from the `Zod` package to validate them.

```js title="env.js"
const z = require("zod");

// ... the code above

// we merge all variables into one object
const _env = {
  ..._clientEnv,
  ..._buildTimeEnv,
};

// merge the two schemas
const merged = buildTime.merge(client);
const parsed = merged.safeParse(_env);

if (parsed.success === false) {
  console.error(
    "❌ Invalid environment variables:",
    parsed.error.flatten().fieldErrors,

    `\n❌ Missing variables in .env.${APP_ENV} file, Make sure all required variables are defined in the .env.${APP_ENV} file.`,
    `\n💡 Tip: If you recently updated the .env.${APP_ENV} file and the error still persists, try restarting the server with the -cc flag to clear the cache.`
  );
  throw new Error(
    "Invalid environment variables, Check terminal for more details "
  );
}

const Env = parsed.data;
const ClientEnv = client.parse(_clientEnv);

module.exports = {
  Env,
  ClientEnv,
};
```

We first merge two schemas into one, called `merged`. Then, we use the `safeParse` function to validate the environment variables. We check if the validation was successful by looking at the `parsed.success` property. If it's `false`, we log an error with a helpful message and throw an exception.

If the validation was successful, we export the `Env` and `ClientEnv` objects. `Env` represents all environment variables, and `ClientEnv` represents the variables that we can access in the `src` folder.

## Step 3: Load the `env.js` file in `app.config.ts`.

Now that we have the `env.js` file ready, we can load it into the `app.config.ts` file and use it to configure the app.

```ts title="app.config.ts"
import type { ConfigContext, ExpoConfig } from "@expo/config";

import { ClientEnv, Env } from "./env";

export default ({ config }: ConfigContext): ExpoConfig => ({
  ...config,
  name: "MyApp",
  // ... the rest config
  ios: {
    bundleIdentifier: Env.BUNDLE_ID,
  },
  extra: {
    ...ClientEnv,
  },
  // .. sentry config and other stuff here
});
```

We can easily import `Env` and `ClientEnv` objects from `env.js` and use them to configure the app. This approach allows us to run multiple versions of the app with different settings in the `.env` files and the `APP_ENV` variable.

The good part here is when we run any Expo command, such as `expo start`, `expo prebuild`, or `expo ios`, the `env.js` file will be loaded first and the validation will be executed before the app starts. If we miss adding any variable, we will get an error like the following:

```bash
❌ Invalid environment variables: { API_URL: [ 'Required' ] }
❌ Missing variables in .env.development file, Make sure all required variables are defined in the .env.development file.
💡 Tip: If you recently updated the .env.development file and the error still persists, try restarting the server with the -cc flag to clear the cache.
```

To ensure our variables are available at runtime, we need to pass the `ClientEnv` object to the `extra` property in the `app.config.ts` file. This way, we can access the variables in the `src` folder using the `Constants.expoConfig.extra` object.

You may be wondering why we should pass the `ClientEnv` object to the `extra` property instead of importing the `env.js` file directly into any file in the `src` folder.

Good question and the answer is simple. We can't import the `env.js` file directly into the `src` folder because it uses the `dotenv` and `path` modules, which are Node modules and can't be used with React Native's runtime. Therefore, importing the `env.js` file directly into the `src` folder will throw an error.

Another important reason is that accessing environment variables with an `extra` property provides an additional layer of security, as our environment variables will not be included as plain text in the JavaScript bundle file.

## Step 4: Access the environment variables in the `src` folder.

We know that we can access the environment variables in the `src` folder using the `Constants.expoConfig.extra` object. But the downside of this approach is that we lose TypeScript support, as the `Constants.expoConfig.extra` object is not typed. So, let's fix this with this simple trick.

Go to the `src` folder and create a new file called `env.js`, and add the following code.

```js title="src/env.js"
/*
 * This file should not be modified; use `env.js` in the project root to add your client environment variables.
 * If you import `Env` from `@env`, this is the file that will be loaded.
 * You can only access the client environment variables here.
 * NOTE: We use js file so we can load the client env types
 */

import Constants from "expo-constants";
/**
 *  @type {typeof import('../../env.js').ClientEnv}
 */
//@ts-ignore // Don't worry about TypeScript here; we know we're passing the correct environment variables to `extra` in `app.config.ts`.
export const Env = Constants.expoConfig?.extra ?? {};
```

This file only exports the `Constants.expoConfig.extra` object. But the interesting part here is that we are using type annotations to get the type of the `ClientEnv` object from the `env.js` root file. This way, we can get typing support for the `Env` object without importing the `env.js` root file directly.

> ⚠️ Make sure you have `"checkJs": true` in your `tsconfig.json` file

You can now import the `Env` object from `src/env.js` and use it to access environment variables. To make this easier, add a resolver for this file to `tsconfig.json` and update your Babel configuration so you can import environment variables with `import { Env } from '@env'`.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "extends": "expo/tsconfig.base",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@env": ["./src/env.js"]
    },
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "checkJs": true
  }
}
```

<br/>

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ["babel-preset-expo"],
    plugins: [
      [
        "module-resolver",
        {
          root: ["./"],
          alias: {
            "@env": "./src/env.js",
          },
          extensions: [
            ".ios.ts",
            ".android.ts",
            ".ts",
            ".ios.tsx",
            ".android.tsx",
            ".tsx",
            ".jsx",
            ".js",
            ".json",
          ],
        },
      ],
    ],
  };
};
```

Congratulations! You can now access environment variables in the `src` folder with TypeScript support. Here's an example:

```tsx title="src/api/client.ts"
import { Env } from "@env";
import axios from "axios";
export const client = axios.create({
  baseURL: Env.API_URL,
});
```

> 🚨 `Unable to resolve module path` means you are trying to import the `path` Node.js module into your app, which will not work because the runtime is different. This issue arises because you are importing the `./env.js` file into a file located in the `./src` folder, which Metro is attempting to bundle. To resolve this, ensure you import your environment variables from `@env`, which should be an [alias](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/a46693e6ddad22bd42e8c03fec623120d9d376d4/babel.config.js#L15) for `./src/core/env.js`, instead of `./env.js`.

## Last words

I know it's a long article, but I hope you find it useful. Before ending this article, I want to add some notes.

- Probably, we didn't talk that much about how secure this approach is? And the answer is that we did our best by accessing the environment variables through the `extra` property, but it is **not 100% secure**. Therefore, if you have critical keys, make sure to put them on the server side.

- Expo 49 SDK automatically loads the `.env` file, which means we probably won't need to use the `dotenv` module to load the file anymore. However, based on my understanding, the solution may not be flexible enough and may not support loading custom environment files(staging for example). Please provide more details in the comments if you think I am missing something here.

- This approach is inspired by [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and i want to thank them for their great work.

- I shared this approach here to get your feedback and improve it, so please let me know in the comments if you have any suggestions.

**Happy coding 🚀**
