![5 Open Source Projects to Learn From](/images/react-native-open-source.jpeg)

<br/>

In my previous article titled "[Github Feed is Underrated](https://elazizi.com/posts/github-feed-is-underrated)," I highlighted the importance of GitHub as a valuable platform for learning from top developers worldwide. It provides a valuable resource for finding new ideas and inspiration that may be challenging to come across in traditional learning formats like articles and courses.

Today, I will demonstrate how you can use GitHub to master React Native. I will share the top 5 open-source React Native projects from which you can learn. I have personally gained valuable knowledge from these projects, and I highly recommend that you take them seriously and make an effort to learn from them.

So let's get started!

## 1. [Showtime Project](https://github.com/showtime-xyz/showtime-frontend/tree/staging)

Showtime is a Web3 social network with a lot of features such as posting, commenting, liking, and following, among others. It's a production app that is utilized by a large number of users. Since they share the codebase between the web and mobile app, they use [Solito](https://solito.dev/), which allows them to use Expo for mobile and Next.js for the web.

I first learned about this project at the [App.js Conf 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl3EH3vUHA) during Axel's presentation on creating a universal design system with React Native. To this day I'm still revisiting the project and uncovering new insights as the project is well maintained and updated regularly.

## 2. [Expensify App](https://github.com/Expensify/App)

Expensify is a complete re-imagination of financial collaboration, centered around chat. A production application(available on ios and Android) used by a large number of users.

Same to the Showtime app, they share code between the web and mobile apps as well.

The project is based on React Native CLI and uses TypeScript. It is well-maintained and regularly updated. It has been heavily tested with unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests. This project offers valuable learning opportunities as well.

## 3. [React Native Testing](https://github.com/vanGalilea/react-native-testing/)

This is not a real app, but rather a collection of examples demonstrating the correct way to test React Native apps. If are willing to test your React Native app using Jest and react-native-testing-library, this is the perfect place to start.

Believe me, what I learned about testing React Native apps from this project is priceless. How to mock native modules, API calls, and navigation. The right way to write your assertions, the correct setup, and much more are all covered in this project.

## 4. [React Native Template Obytes](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes)

This is a React Native starter that we use at Obytes for new projects and is based on the Expo dev client and TypeScript. The starter comes with a lot of features out of the box, such as authentication, navigation, localization, form handling, environment variable validation, theme, GitHub Actions, and much more.

Normally, we build this project for everyone who wants to create a new project and start with a solid foundation. However, I have noticed that a lot of people have been using it as a source of inspiration and for learning purposes lately.

## 5. [bluesky App](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app)

BlueSky is a social media app similar to Twitter. The project is based on Expo and supports web, iOS, and Android, with a lot of features similar to what you see on Twitter.

The project is also well-tested with unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests. It is well-maintained and updated regularly and uses Expo 48 SDK
