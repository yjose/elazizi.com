![5+ Github Actions for React native](/images/github-action-checks.png)

<br/>

If you are working with React Native and hosting your project on GitHub but not using GitHub Actions, you are missing out on a lot of benefits. GitHub Actions is a great tool that can help you automate your React Native workflow and save you a lot of time and effort.

I believe that having GitHub workflows is one of the best investments you can make in your project to enhance productivity and code quality. Writing these workflows can be done in just a few days or even hours. However, if you are lucky enough‚Äîwhich is the case as you are reading this article üòä‚Äîyou can benefit from other people's work and make your setup ready in a few minutes.

In this article, I will share with you a few GitHub Actions workflows we use for our React Native projects that you can also use.

Before we start listing the workflows, I would like to mention a small trick that we use in those workflows tha not many people know that this is possible with GitHub Actions. (Me, a few months ago üòÖ)

## Making a workflow reusable.

Most of these workflows require common steps, such as node setup, installing dependencies, and caching. Instead of repeating those steps in every workflow, we can create a reusable workflow that can be used in other workflows.

To make it work, GitHub requires using a composite action. A composite action is an action that can be used in other workflows. It's like a function that you can call from other workflows.

For our case, to create a [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) to set up the project, we need to create a new folder in our project called `.github/actions` and create a new file inside it called `setup-node-pnpm-install/action.yml`. This file will contain the steps that will be executed when you call this action and should specify the type as `composite`. Here is how it looks like:

```yml title=".github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install/action.yml"
# üîó Links:
# Source file: https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install/action.yml

name: "Setup  Node + PNPM + Install Dependencies"
description: "Setup  Node + PNPM + Install Dependencies"
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      with:
        version: 8
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: "pnpm"

    - name: üì¶ Install Project Dependencies
      run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      shell: bash
```

Now, we can use this action in other workflows by calling it using the `uses` keyword and specifying the path to the action file. Note that you don't need to include the `action.yml`; only the folder name is required.

````yml

```yml
- name: üì¶ Setup Node + PNPM + install deps
  uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install
````

Now that we have the setup ready, let's begin listing the workflows.

## 1. Type Checking

I assume that you are using TypeScript in your project. If not, you should consider giving it a try. Believe me, it's worth it.

```yml title=".github/workflows/type-check.yml"
# üîó Links:
# Source file: https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/type-check.yml

name: Type Check (tsc)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  type-check:
    name: Type Check (tsc)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: üì¶ Checkout project repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: üì¶ Setup Node + PNPM + install deps
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install

      - name: üì¶ Install Reviewdog
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        uses: reviewdog/action-setup@v1

      - name: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run TypeScript PR # Reviewdog tsc errorformat: %f:%l:%c - error TS%n: %m
        # we only need to add the reviewdog step if it's a pull request
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        run: |
          pnpm type-check | reviewdog -name="tsc" -efm="%f(%l,%c): error TS%n: %m" -reporter="github-pr-review" -filter-mode="nofilter" -fail-on-error -tee
        env:
          REVIEWDOG_GITHUB_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name:
          üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run TypeScript Commit
          # If it's not a Pull Request then we just need to run the type-check
        if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        run: pnpm type-check
```

This workflow will run the type check on every push to the `main/master` branch and on every pull request to `main/master`. If it's a pull request, it will add the check to the PR as well as annotate the code with the errors using reviewdog.

## 2. Linting with ESLint

This workflow will run the linting on every push to the `main/master` branch and on every pull request to `main/master`. If it's a pull request, it will add the check to the PR as well as annotate the code with waring and errors with reviewdog.

```yml title=".github/workflows/lint-ts.yml"
# üîó Links:
# Source file: https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/lint-ts.yml

name: Lint TS (eslint, prettier)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint TS (eslint, prettier)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: üì¶ Checkout project repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: üì¶ Setup Node + PNPM + install deps
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install

      - name: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run ESLint PR
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        uses: reviewdog/action-eslint@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          reporter: github-pr-review
          eslint_flags: ". --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx"

      - name: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run ESLint PR
        if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        run: pnpm run lint
```

## 3. Expo Doctor Check

This workflow runs the expo doctor command to check if your project dependencies are aligned with the expo sdk version you are using. It can be triggered manually from the Actions tab in your project. or automatically on every push to the `main/master` branch and on every pull request to `main/master` in case the `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` files have been changed.

```yml title=".github/workflows/expo-doctor.yml"
# üîó Links:
# Source file: https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/expo-doctor.yml

name: Expo Doctor (expo)

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
    paths:
      - "package.json"
      - "pnpm-lock.yaml"
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "package.json"
      - "pnpm-lock.yaml"

jobs:
  doctor:
    name: Expo Doctor (expo)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: üì¶ Checkout project repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: üì¶ Setup Node + PNPM + install deps
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install

      - name: üöë Run Doctor Checks
        run: npx expo-doctor@latest
```

> üëÄ A fun idea is to add a comment to the pull request (PR) with the output of the `expo doctor` command. You could even set up a workflow to run this every week and open a PR if there is a new version of the Expo SDK.

## 4. Unit Tests

This workflow runs the unit tests on every push to the `main/master` branch and on every pull request to `main/master`. If it's a pull request, it will post a comment with the coverage details. as well as annotate the test results directly in Github.

```yml title=".github/workflows/test.yml"
# üîó Links:
# Source file: https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml

name: Tests (jest)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Tests (jest)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: üì¶ Checkout project repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: üì¶ Setup Node + PNPM + install deps
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install

      - name: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run Tests
        run: pnpm run test:ci

      - name: Jest Coverage Comment
        uses: MishaKav/jest-coverage-comment@main
        if: (success() || failure()) && github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        with:
          coverage-summary-path: ./coverage/coverage-summary.json
          summary-title: "üíØ Test Coverage"
          badge-title: Coverage
          create-new-comment: false
          junitxml-title: üòé Tests Results
          junitxml-path: ./coverage/jest-junit.xml
          coverage-title: üëÄ Tests Details
          coverage-path: ./coverage/coverage.txt
          report-only-changed-files: true
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To ensure proper functionality, you need to make sure that your Jest configuration is set up to generate coverage files in the specified format. You can refer to the [jest.config.js](https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/jest.config.js) file for more information.

Here is an example of the comment that will be posted on the pull request.

## 5. Image Optimization

Unoptimized images can cause various issues in your app, including performance problems and increased app size. This workflow ensures that all images in your project are optimized and compressed.

The workflow runs whenever there is a push to the `main/master` branch containing changes to image files. It will then open a pull request with the optimized images.

```yml title=".github/workflows/compress-images.yml"
# üîó Links:
# Source file: https://github.com/obytes/react-native-template-obytes/blob/master/.github/workflows/compress-images.yml

name: Compress images
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
    paths:
      - "**.jpg"
      - "**.jpeg"
      - "**.png"
      - "**.webp"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Compress Images
        id: calibre
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@main
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          compressOnly: true
          ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,ios/**,android/**"

      - name: Create Pull Request
        if: steps.calibre.outputs.markdown != ''
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          title: Auto Compress Images
          branch-suffix: timestamp
          commit-message: Compress Images
          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}
```

## 6. More Workflows

I mentioned above the most common workflows we use in our projects. However, we have more workflows that you can find in our [Workflow References](https://starter.obytes.com/ci-cd/workflows-references/) including:

- [EAS Production build](https://starter.obytes.com/ci-cd/workflows-references/#publishing-to-expo)

- [EAS Preview build](https://starter.obytes.com/ci-cd/workflows-references/#%EF%B8%8F-eas-build-prod) -[ End to End (E2E) tests](https://starter.obytes.com/ci-cd/workflows-references/#%EF%B8%8F-e2e-test-for-android)

- [New App Version](https://starter.obytes.com/ci-cd/workflows-references/#%EF%B8%8F-new-app-version)
