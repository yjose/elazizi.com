![Views Counter](/images/views-count.gif)

A few months ago, I wrote an article about [adding a comments section to your Astro blog](/posts/add-comments-section-to-your-astro-blog) using Giscus, and I was thrilled to see how many people found it helpful. Following that success, I decided to share another useful feature that can enhance your blog: a views counter for your articles.

Adding a views counter to your blog posts is a great way to track engagement and show your readers how popular your articles are. In this guide, I'll show you how to implement a beautiful and animated views counter for your Astro blog using a free hit counter service.

## Table of Content

## üéØ The Solution

The solution is very simple and dosnt require any server side code or API keys. We'll use [hits.seeyoufarm.com](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/), a free and reliable hit counter service that doesn't require any authentication or API keys. The service provides a simple URL-based API that returns an SVG badge with the view count. We'll extract the count from this badge and display it with a smooth animation.

## üëÄ Page Views Component

Without any further ado, here is the code for the `PageViews` component, you only need to add this to your blog post layout and pass the current page URL to it.

```astro
---

export interface Props {
  url: string;
}
const { url = "" } = Astro.props;

const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(url);
const counterUrl = `https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=${encodedUrl}&count_bg=%234E763000&title_bg=%237A464600&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=Reads+%28Today+%2F+All+Time%29+%3A&edge_flat=true`;

<div class="flex gap-1 opacity-80 justify-center items-center pl-2">
  <svg class="fill-transparent w-5 h-5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"  viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" >
    <path d="M2.062 12.348a1 1 0 0 1 0-.696 10.75 10.75 0 0 1 19.876 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 .696 10.75 10.75 0 0 1-19.876 0"/>
    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"/>
  </svg>
  <span id="views-count" class="inline-flex items-end min-w-[30px]">
    <span class="loading-dot">.</span>
    <span class="loading-dot">.</span>
    <span class="loading-dot">.</span>
  </span>
</div>

<style>
  @keyframes loadingDots {
    0% {
      opacity: 0.2;
    }
    20% {
      opacity: 1;
    }
    100% {
      opacity: 0.2;
    }
  }

  .loading-dot {
    animation: loadingDots 1.4s infinite;
    animation-fill-mode: both;
  }

  .loading-dot:nth-child(2) {
    animation-delay: 0.2s;
  }

  .loading-dot:nth-child(3) {
    animation-delay: 0.4s;
  }
</style>

<script define:vars={{ counterUrl }}>
  function animateNumber(start, end, duration, element) {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    const startNumber = parseInt(start);
    const targetNumber = parseInt(end);
    const difference = targetNumber - startNumber;

    function easeOutCubic(t) {
      return 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 3);
    }

    function update(currentTime) {
      const elapsed = currentTime - startTime;
      const progress = Math.min(elapsed / duration, 1);

      const easedProgress = easeOutCubic(progress);
      const currentNumber = Math.round(startNumber + (difference * easedProgress));

      // Format number with commas for better readability
      element.textContent = currentNumber.toLocaleString();

      if (progress < 1) {
        requestAnimationFrame(update);
      }
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(update);
  }

  async function fetchWithProxy(targetUrl) {
    const proxyUrl = "https://corsproxy.io/?" + encodeURIComponent(targetUrl);
    const response = await fetch(proxyUrl);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    return response.text();
  }

  async function updateViewCount() {
    const viewsCount = document.getElementById("views-count");
    if (!viewsCount) return;

    try {
      const svgText = await fetchWithProxy(counterUrl);
      const match = svgText.match(
        /<text[^>]*fill="#fff"[^>]*>([\d\s/]+)<\/text>/
      );

      if (match && match[1]) {
        const count = match[1].trim();
        const totalViews = count.split("/")[1].trim();
        viewsCount.textContent = "0"; // Start from zero
        animateNumber(0, totalViews, 1000, viewsCount); // Animate to actual count over 1 second
      } else {
        viewsCount.textContent = "N/A";
      }
    } catch {
      viewsCount.textContent = "N/A";
    }
  }

  updateViewCount();
</script>

```

Let's break down and explain the code.

The component is very simple, it accepts a `url` prop that will be used to track views for specific pages. We create a simple eye icon for the visual appeal of the counter and we use a three dots loading animation to make it more appealing.

In the script section, we have a function called `updateViewCount` that handles fetching and displaying the view count. Here's how it works:

1. It first fetches the SVG content from the hit counter service using the `fetchWithProxy` function to handle CORS
2. Since the service returns an SVG containing the view count, we use a regular expression to extract the numeric value
3. The regex pattern `/<text[^>]*fill="#fff"[^>]*>([\d\s/]+)<\/text>/` matches text elements in the SVG and captures the view count
4. Once we have the count, we initialize the display at 0 and animate up to the actual value
5. If there are any errors in fetching or parsing, we gracefully fall back to showing "N/A"

Once we have the view count, we use the `animateNumber` function to create a smooth animation effect. This function animates the counter from 0 to the actual view count over a 1 second duration. Under the hood, it leverages the browser's `requestAnimationFrame` API to create a fluid easing animation with optimal performance. The easing effect makes the counting animation feel more polished and natural compared to an instant update or linear transition.

## üìù Using the Page Views Component in Your Blog

To add the views counter to your blog posts, import and use the `PageViews` component in your blog post layout:

```astro
---
import PageViews from "@components/PageViews.astro";

const pageUrl = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.url.origin).href;

---

<article>
  <h1>{post.title}</h1>
  <div class="metadata">
    <span class="date">{formattedDate}</span>
    <PageViews url={pageUrl} />
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <slot />
  </div>
</article>
```

## ‚ú® The Result

Go to the top of the page and you'll see the page views counter for this page.
